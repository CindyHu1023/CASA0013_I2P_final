# Executive Summary  
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb performance in London, using datasets obtained from the Inside Airbnb website compiled on 16 December 2020. Based on python technology, we analyze some impacts of the Covid19 pandemic on short term rental platforms such as Airbnb and made recommendations on how to operate during the epidemic.  
## Key Findings
As the analysis suggest, people renting a room during the Covid19 epidemic are more concerned with the type and the location of properties, as it is about their ability to keep social distancing from others and prevent being infected. Therefore, entire apartments in central London are more popular, followed by private rooms in an apartment located in the suburbs.  
## Recommendations
Based on the findings, there are three promotional suggestions for hosts and investors in London to attract consumers during the pandemic:  
1. Residents who own a spare entire flat in central London can register as an Airbnb host to rent out their apartment, while landlords owning multiple properties may consider mainly renting out entire apartment and only renting out shared rooms in areas where the Covid19 is not severe.     
2. Hosts can modify their room descriptions to highlight features such as clean rooms and neighbourhood, friendly community, etc.   
3. All rooms for rent should be disinfected and the safety of the tenants need to be guaranteed.
